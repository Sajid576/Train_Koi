## Installation Guide:


- Download and install Android Studio.
- Start Android Studio, and go through the ‘Android Studio Setup Wizard’. This installs the latest Android SDK, Android SDK Command-line Tools, and Android SDK Build-Tools, which are required by Flutter when developing for Android.

##### Set up your Android device 
- To prepare to run and test your Flutter app on an Android device, you need an Android device running Android 4.1 (API level 16) or higher.

- Enable Developer options and USB debugging on your device. Detailed instructions are available in the Android documentation.

- Using a USB cable, plug your phone into your computer. If prompted on your device, authorize your computer to access your device.
In the terminal, run the flutter devices command to verify that Flutter recognizes your connected Android device. By default, Flutter uses the version of the Android SDK where your adb tool is based. If you want Flutter to use a different installation of the Android SDK, you must set the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable to that installation directory.

##### Get the flutter SDK

- Go to the SDK archive page(https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases) to see all releases of Flutter SDK.

- Create the new folder as flutter into C:\src (C:\src\flutter) and extract the Flutter SDK zip file in to there.

- After extracting the Flutter SDK, Start it by double-clicking on flutter_console.bat inside the Flutter file.

After finishing this all, now you can run the flutter commands in the flutter console.

If you wish to run the Flutter commands in regular windows console, You have to set up the environment variable for flutter path.
